                    <strong>Today, the success rate for dental implants is close to 98%.</strong>

                <p class="heading-sub">
                    Why would you need a dental implant?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dental implants can be used to replace -
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="text-point">
                        A single tooth,
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-point">
                        Several teeth or 
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-point">
                        All of the teeth.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The goal of teeth replacement in dentistry is to restore function as well as esthetics. <br>
                    When it comes to tooth replacement, generally, there are three options:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="text-point">Removable dental appliance (complete denture or partial denture),</li>
                    <li class="text-point">Fixed dental bridge (cemented), and</li>
                    <li class="text-point">Dental implant.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Dentures are the more affordable option for replacement teeth but are the least desirable because of the inconvenience of a removable appliance in the mouth. Furthermore, dentures can affect one's taste and sensory experience with food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dental bridgework was the more common restorative option prior to the relatively recent shift to dental implant treatment. The main disadvantage to bridgework is the dependence on existing natural teeth for support. Implants are supported by bone only and do not affect surrounding natural teeth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Deciding on which option to choose depends on many factors. Specifically for dental implants, these factors include -
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="text-point">Location of missing tooth or teeth</li>
                    <li class="text-point">Quantity and quality of the jawbone where the dental implant is to be placed</li>
                    <li class="text-point">Health of the patient</li>
                    <li class="text-point">Cost</li>
                    <li class="text-point">Patient preference.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A dental surgeon examines the area to be considered for the dental implant and makes a clinical assessment of whether the patient is a good candidate for a dental implant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are great advantages to choosing a dental implant for tooth replacement over the other options. Dental implants are conservative in that missing teeth can be replaced without affecting or altering the adjacent teeth. Furthermore, because dental implants integrate into the bone structure, they are very stable and can have the look and feel of one's own natural teeth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some other uses -
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="text-point"> While the primary function of dental implants is for teeth replacement, there are areas in which implants can assist in other dental procedures. Due to their stability, dental implants can be used to support a removable denture and provide a more secure and comfortable fit.</li>
                    <li class="text-point">In addition, for orthodontics procedures, dental mini-implants can act as temporary anchorage devices (TAD) to help move teeth to a desired position. These mini-implants are small and temporarily fixed to bone while assisting in anchorage for teeth movement. They are subsequently removed after their function has been served.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For patients who have lost all their teeth due to decay or gum disease of the upper and/or lower arch, an option is available to provide a very stable and comfortable prosthesis using a minimal number of implants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One such is example is the "All-On-4" technique that was named by implant manufacturer Nobel Biocare. This technique gets its name from the idea that four implants can be used to replace all teeth in a single arch (upper or lower). The implants are strategically placed in areas of good strong bone, and a thin denture prosthesis is screwed into place. The All-On-4 technique provides teeth replacement that is stable (not removable) and feels like natural teeth compared to the older method of traditional (removable) complete dentures. Without a doubt, implant dentistry has allowed for more treatment options to replace single and multiple missing teeth with long-term stability and contributes to improved oral health.

                <p class="heading-sub">
                    Procedure -
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="text-point">During the consult and planning stage, the dental surgeon will visually examine the site in the mouth where a dental implant is being considered as well as look at dental imaging studies (X-rays, panoramic films, and/or CT scans).</li>
                    <li class="text-point">At this time, the quality and quantity of jawbone is assessed to determine if more bone is needed at the site.</li>
                    <li class="text-point">Once it has been established that a dental implant can be placed in the desired location, the patient will return for surgical procedures for the dental implant(s).</li>
                    <li class="text-point">During all surgical procedure appointments, the patient is usually given local anesthetic to numb the surgical area.</li>
                    <li class="text-point">Once adequate, strong bone is present, the site is ready for the implant.</li>
                    <li class="text-point">At the implant placement appointment, the dental implant (titanium post) is placed into the bone with a special drill and tools.</li>
                    <li class="text-point">A "healing cap" is placed over the implant, the gum is stitched up, and the healing phase begins.</li>
                    <li class="text-point"> During this healing phase, a temporary denture can be made to replace missing teeth for esthetic purposes. Healing time depends greatly on the quality of bone present. Healing time is usually anywhere from two to six months.</li>
                    <li class="text-point">During this time, the implant becomes integrated with the bone. It's important to avoid placing any force or stress on the dental implant as it heals.</li>
                    <li class="text-point">Follow-up appointments to check the surgical site are typically done to ensure that no infection exists and healing is taking place.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    After the required healing period, the dental implant is tested to determine whether it was successfully taken up by the surrounding bone. Once this has been confirmed, a prosthetic component is connected to the dental implant via a screw. This component is called an "abutment." It will serve to hold the replacement tooth or "crown." <br>
                    The dentist will take an impression (mold) of this abutment in the mouth and have the implant crown custom-made to fit. The implant crown is either cemented on or secured with a screw to the abutment.

                    How much does a dental implant cost?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cost of a single dental implant can vary depending on the region and who is performing the procedure. 
                </p>
                <p class="heading-sub">
                    What are the potential risks, complications, and problems with a dental implant?
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="text-point">With any surgery, there are always some risks and potential complications to the patient or to the success of a dental implant.</li>
                    <li class="text-point">Careful planning is important to ensure that a patient is healthy enough to undergo oral surgery and heal properly.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="heading-sub">
                    Is dental implant surgery painful?
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="text-point">Dental implant surgery is usually performed under local anesthetic, and therefore, no pain should be felt during the procedure.</li>
                    <li class="text-point">After the local anesthetic has worn off, the post-surgery discomfort will vary with each individual case.</li>
                    <li class="text-point">However, in general, most people will feel discomfort similar to a tooth extraction afterward.</li>
                    <li class="text-point">A cold ice pack is placed on skin over the area of surgery immediately after treatment to help reduce swelling.</li>
                    <li class="text-point">This pain typically can be managed with over-the-counter pain medications.</li>
                    <li class="text-point">Aside from pain medications, prescriptions for antibiotics and oral rinses may be needed to support healing of the area for the following few weeks.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="heading-sub">
                    What follow-up care is necessary after getting a dental implant?
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="text-point">Dental implants have the risk of developing a condition called "peri-implantitis," which is the equivalent of periodontal (gum) disease for natural teeth. This refers to inflammation of the gum and bone surrounding the implant.</li>
                    <li class="text-point">The inflammation of the surrounding tissues is often due to excessive biting forces on the implant or bacterial infection.</li>
                    <li class="text-point">Peri-implantitis can result in the loss of an implant if left untreated.</li>
                    <li class="text-point">After getting a dental implant, routine maintenance care at home and follow-up at the dental office are essential in avoiding this condition.</li>
                    <li class="text-point">Good oral hygiene for a dental implant at home involves routine brushing and flossing to keep food debris and plaque away. </li>
