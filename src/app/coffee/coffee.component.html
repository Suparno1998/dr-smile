                    In short, yes. Although, it's certainly not the worst thing for them. The pH level of coffee is mildly acidic around a 5. 
                    <br>
                    There are many other popular drinks and foods that can have a worse pH - and consequently worse acidity. Even typical healthy foods like lemons and oranges can be more damaging in terms of acidity. 
                    <br>
                    But don't worry, there are ways to mitigate the effects of coffee on teeth health. First, let's learn the ways in which coffee can harm your teeth, and then we'll discuss what to do with your specific situation.

                            <strong>Coffee Can Stain and Discolor Teeth</strong> <br>
                            Coffee, much like tea, wine, and some other plant-based foods, contains tannins. When placed in water these tannins break down. When they break down they cause colour which latches onto your teeth. As a result, discoloration begins. This is different from the yellowing caused by enamel wearing away, and it's much easier to fix. Be sure to keep reading to learn what can cause your enamel to be damaged. If you are worried about the colour of your teeth for any reason, it's a good idea to consult your dentist. They might be able to help you fix it. Currently, Zoom Whitening is becoming popular as a quick way to gain a noticeably brighter smile.

                            <strong>Coffee Can Cause Cavities</strong> <br>
                            If you drink a lot of coffee you are at risk of significant tooth damage if you are not careful. Coffee is an acidic drink. And, just like other acidic drinks like lemonade and red wine, it can damage your tooth enamel. Your enamel eroding can cause your teeth to become more thin and brittle over time. It's important to keep your teeth strong so you aren't prone to sensitivity and expensive cavities.

                            <strong>Coffee Can Make Your Teeth More Yellow</strong> <br>
                            Similar to how coffee and other acidic drinks can cause cavities, the same process also causes a yellow appearance. This is because your enamel is being worn away by the acidity. This causes a lower layer of your teeth, called the dentin, to become exposed. This can cause a more yellow appearance that is beyond the typical discoloration seen from drinking darker beverages.

                            <strong>Coffee Can Cause Teeth Sensitivity</strong> <br>
                            Your tooth enamel is what protects your teeth from sensitivity problems as well as decay. When that enamel begins to wear away, you are more likely to experience tooth sensitivity.  This potentially painful when you are consuming things at different temperatures. It could also be the first step towards the aforementioned cavities.

                            <strong>It Isn't Just Coffee</strong> <br>
                            There are many foods and drinks that we tend to consume that are just as bad for our teeth. Coffee happens to be one of the most talked about, but it's important to discuss others so you can be aware.  Many popular drinks are bad for your teeth health, not merely coffee. Red wine, dark teas, dark juices, and soft drinks are also large culprits for teeth staining.

                    But What About Black Coffee?
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you only drink black coffee, you are actually having less of an effect on your teeth health than other ways of drinking coffee. If you are drinking coffee with lots of sugar or cream, this is actually worse for your teeth.
                    <br>
                    If you're looking for a quick way to improve your dental situation, consider switching to black coffee. Flavoured creamers tend to have sugar in them which is more damaging for your teeth. Outright adding sugar to your coffee is also worse for your teeth health. 
                    <br>
                    If you consume a great deal of coffee, it might be a good idea to cut back somewhat. Not only is drinking too much coffee bad for you in general, but it's also especially bad for your teeth.
                    <br>
                    Drinking too many caffeinated beverages can cause a number of side effects, from mild dizziness to an abnormal heart rate. Generally, it's accepted that drinking more than six cups of regular coffee a day puts you more at risk for things like cardiovascular disease.

                            Of course, if you're concerned it is a good idea to head for one of your biannual teeth cleanings. This is one of the best ways to check up on the damage and make decisions about how to proceed. There are always more reasons to schedule your dental cleaning, especially if you've been lagging during the pandemic. Check out these 7 Eye-Opening Reasons to Schedule a Dental Cleaning.

                            Specific to improving your black coffee and perhaps black tea, adding milk will lighten the colour of the drink. The colour of drinks has been linked with discoloration, which is why dark juices and dark teas are more likely to cause issues. While this won't help you with the acidity necessarily, it will at least help with the staining.

                            <strong>Straws</strong> <br>
                            One of the easiest ways to prevent teeth damage is to drink your coffee through a straw. Consider using a paper or reusable straw, though, as plastic straws are bad for the environment. Straws are useful for protecting your teeth because they tend to lessen how much coffee actually gets on your teeth. It can especially prevent visible stains since the coffee will be more on the inside than outside. And, your front teeth won't be bearing the brunt of the coffee deluge.

                            <strong>Water</strong> <br>
                            After drinking something acidic, it's a good idea to drink some water. By drinking water, you can wash away some of the acidity still sticking to your teeth. With less acid on your teeth, there won't be as much damage. Of course, drinking water is important for your health in more ways than one. Coffee can have a mild diuretic effect, and while it's unlikely to dehydrate you it's always a good idea to drink more water.

                            This may seem counter-intuitive. But if you have recently been drinking an acidic drink, it's a good idea to wait at least 15 minutes before brushing your teeth. This gives your teeth a chance to recover from the acidity. The time will give your enamel a chance to re-harden. This goes for other acidic drinks as well!

                            Crunchy, less acidic fruits are excellent for scrubbing your teeth and producing more saliva. In a way, they are a natural stain remover for your teeth. Although, they won't help as much as actually brushing your teeth and they aren't as good at preventing enamel damage.

                            There are many reasons why you should consider an upgrade to an electric toothbrush. They are significantly better at removing plaque and other residues from your teeth, for one. But they are also far more effective than a normal toothbrush at removing the acidity left behind from drinking coffee.
