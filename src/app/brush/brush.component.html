                    Brushing your teeth is an important part of your dental care routine. For a healthy mouth and smile the ADA recommends you:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="text-point">
                        Brush your teeth twice a day with a soft-bristled brush. The size and shape of your brush should fit your mouth allowing you to reach all areas easily.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-point">
                        Replace your toothbrush every three or four months, or sooner if the bristles are frayed. A worn toothbrush won’t do a good job of cleaning your teeth.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-point">
                        Make sure to use an ADA-accepted fluoride toothpaste.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="heading-sub">
                    The proper brushing technique is to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="text-point">
                        Place your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to the gums.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-point">
                        Gently move the brush back and forth in short (tooth-wide) strokes.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-point">
                        Brush the outer surfaces, the inner surfaces, and the chewing surfaces of the teeth.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-point">
                        To clean the inside surfaces of the front teeth, tilt the brush vertically and make several up-and-down strokes.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Of course, brushing your teeth is only a part of a complete dental care routine. You should also make sure to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="text-point">
                        Clean between teeth daily once a day. Tooth decay-causing bacteria still linger between teeth
where toothbrush bristles can’t reach. This helps remove plaque and food particles from
between the teeth and under the gum line.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-point">
                        Eat a balanced diet that limits sugary beverages and snacks.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-point">
                        Brush the outer surfaces, the inner surfaces, and the chewing surfaces of the teeth.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-point">
                        See your dentist regularly for prevention and treatment of oral disease.
                    </li>
                </ul>
